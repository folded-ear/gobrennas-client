# Coding Guidelines

This is intended to be a document to help outline the coding structure, best practices and other guidelines for working in this code base. It's meant really as living notes for myself, since there are big gaps between when I can work on stuff and I forget things.

## Work in Progress

There are lots of inconsistencies in the code base because we are in the middle of transitioning away from flux and to graphql.

## Folder structure
